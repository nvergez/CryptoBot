# CryptoBot
CryptoBot is a trading bot using the platform Binance.
It can trade with BTC and ETH from EUR.

## Getting started
You must create a .env_key file at the project's root with this template:
```
# API BINANCE
API_KEY=your_key
API_SECRET=your_secret
```
You can create your key and secret [here](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072-How-to-create-API).
When you have your .env_key file you can build and run the project with `docker-compose up --build`.
